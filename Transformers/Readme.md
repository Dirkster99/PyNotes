The NLP Transformers library from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html#quick-tour) provides
models for PyTorch or TensorFlow which are pretrained to solve a specific task. These notebooks show how a model can be
downloaded and be used in a local environment without Internet:

- [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english Model Download Save.ipynb](distilbert_base_uncased_finetuned_sst_2_english_Model_Download_Save.ipynb)  
  [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english Load.ipynb](distilbert_base_uncased_finetuned_sst_2_english_Load.ipynb)  
  These Jupyter Notebooks document how a model can be saved to loacal storage (using CoLab as an example environment) und using the local model from disk to make predictions on a 'sentiment-analysis' task for English text.

Additional notebooks show how [Sentiment Analysis and MultiClass Classification](LocalModelUsage_Finetuning/Readme.md) can be implemented based on fine-tuning an existing model.
