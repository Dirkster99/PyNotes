Contains files that document the usage of the NLP Transformers library from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html#quick-tour)
to implement:

- Sentiment Analysis

- MultiClass Classification by fine tuning a model that was originally designed for Sentiment Analysis

Every notebook in this folder requires local data and models, which should be useful for those who compute
in an environment that has no Internet connection. Please review the [distilbert_base_uncased_finetuned_sst_2_english_Model_Download_Save.ipynb](../distilbert_base_uncased_finetuned_sst_2_english_Model_Download_Save.ipynb) notebook to find out how Transformers
models can be saved for local/fine tuning usage.
